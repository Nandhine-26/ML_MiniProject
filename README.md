Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for analyzing e-commerce customer behavior and predicting satisfaction levels. We implement principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, compare classification algorithms, and develop ensemble methods.

Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline with SMOTE, one-hot encoding, and z-score normalization
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Comparison of Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Stacking, and Voting classifiers
- Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the code

Results
- Optimized Random Forest model achieves 100% accuracy
- Ensemble methods outperform individual classifiers
- PCA enhances model efficiency without sacrificing accuracy

Future Work
- Real-time deployment with API integration
- Deep learning approaches for temporal analysis
- Cross-platform validation studies
